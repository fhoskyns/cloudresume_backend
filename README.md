This is the Backend folder for my Cloud Resume website.

It contains the SAM Application, formed of:
1. Lambda function (written in Python, with an empty requirements.txt file)
2. samconfig.toml (profile is commented out using hashtag so that CodePipeline works)
3. template.yml (where the SAM instructions are contained)
